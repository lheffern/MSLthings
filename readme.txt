Download kernels into a kernels folder;
Download metakernels into a MetaKernels folder
Run in python 3.6+ (I use 3.10)
conda to get spiceypy (ee thier online documentation here: https://spiceypy.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/main/pdf/

Enjoy, email if there's any questions: lheffern@asu.edu or lena.heffern@swri.org

All this code can be figured out with free online tools, this is not proprietary.

You will need to change the PATH in the MetalKernal files
You will need to change the PATH in the python script


I also included all the python files from the examples for the JPL free oline SPICE class.
Here's my workshop notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tm5nSUHHE04iC71V4nQWyKRsA31Q5yfY9PzQnS3STpU/edit?usp=sharing

IMPORTANT:
You need to download these kernels from the NAIF data archive:
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/MSL/kernels/spk/mars085s.bsp
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/MAVEN/kernels/spk/mars097s.bsp

They were too big for github (95MB).
